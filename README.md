LemonReportBundle
========================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/stanlemon/report-bundle.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/stanlemon/report-bundle)

This bundle is a work in progress.

This bundle takes a list of reports configured in a persistence layer, like a database, and provides
several standard ways of rendering them.

####Todos:
- Figure out a better way of abstracting the route generator, this is needed for
  pagerfanta as well as for the views themselves.
- Write tests for all the things.
